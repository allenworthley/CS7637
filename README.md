- Used Pillow and NumPy to identity an image that satisfied the logical progression of images. 
- Correctly Identified 61 of the 96 image sets leveraging a hierarchical knowledge-based system. 
- Program utilized multiple strategies including quantifying the density change in pixels between images 
  (DPR/IPR) and testing affine transformations for simple logical leaps in images
